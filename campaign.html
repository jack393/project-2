				Although the ocean is in a crucial state that may risk the future of its
				animals and habitats, there are ways to help fix it. Cleaning up the ocean 
				is a global problem that needs to be fixed now before it's too late. Ways you
				can do this include going to beach clean ups or donating to non profit organizations
				that are devoted to making the ocean a cleaner place. Heal the bay holds beach 
				clean ups every third Sunday of the month in a different location around LA county.
				Their are incidents because of the oceans slow death that are happening all over
				the world. For example the coral reef off of cancun protects the tourists and
				people on the beach from big swell and other dangers. It also attracts a ton
				of tourists every that makes a lot of money for cancun. So get out there and
				help save our vastly important ocean.
